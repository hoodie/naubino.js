#Roadmap:
	* restore original gameplay ( 1.0 )
	  * circle for naub overflow
	  * menu
	* alternating game modes

# Known Issues
	* bug         : keep on looking for the 3-way-join-bug
	* bug         : naubs kinda jiggle in chromium (due to pre rendering)

# wishes
	* improve  : more canvas performance optimization possible
	* improve  : replace 1000/n fps calculation with requestAnimationFrame
	* beauty   : color palettes also handle background and join color (for theming)
